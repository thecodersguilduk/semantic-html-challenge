# Tips

* Get control of your [table-layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/table-layout).

* Think about your [font stack](https://www.thoughtco.com/font-stack-definition-3467414).

* Make your table markup as simple as possible, and keep things flexible, e.g. by using percentages, so the design is more responsive.

* Use [table-layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/table-layout): fixed to create a more predictable table layout that allows you to easily set column widths by setting [width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) on their headings ([th](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th)).

* Use [border-collapse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-collapse): collapse to make table elements borders collapse into each other, producing a neater and easier to control look.

* Use [thead](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead), [tbody](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody), and [tfoot](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot) to break up your table into logical chunks and provide extra places to apply CSS to, so it is easier to layer styles on top of one another if required.

* Use zebra striping to make alternate rows easier to read.

* Use [text-align](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) to line up your [th](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) and [td](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) text, to make things neater and easier to follow.
